# fuser-ember-cli

This repo is the development environment to create [FusorUi](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/ui/) which a rails engine that is added to [Foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/).

[FusorUi](https://github.com/fusor/ui/) is essentially the output from this repo which is an [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) project that contains assets such as javascript, stylesheets, images, and fonts.

## Important Note

The fuser-ember-cli/dist directory is the [.gitignore](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/blob/master/.gitignore) so you wont find it in this repository.

The fuser-ember-cli/dist distory is generated automatically by [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) when you run `ember server` or `ember build` locally inside the this directory.

## Development Workflow

1. Ensure that your [Foreman settings.yaml](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/) has `login: false`. Otherwise, API calls will not authenticate properly.
2. Clone [fusor](https://github.com/fusor/fusor/) to your local workstation.
3. `cd fusor-ember-cli`
4. In [controllers/application.js](https://github.com/fusor/fusor-ember-cli/blob/master/app/controllers/application.js#L8), change `deployAsPlugin` from `true` to `false`. If `false`, it shows a menu bar for development which is not needed when running inside Foreman/Katello.
5. [Update your ember-cli-build.js to include these lines](https://github.com/isratrade/fusor/blob/devpick/fusor-ember-cli/ember-cli-build.js#L30-#L68)
6. Run $ ember server --proxy http://sat61dev.example.com/ or whatever URL of your Foreman/Katello instance. This tells the ember server to proxy API calls to Foreman/Katello:
7. HAPPY HACKING!
8. BEFORE running next step, in [controllers/application.js](https://github.com/fusor/fusor-ember-cli/blob/master/app/controllers/application.js#L8), change `deployAsPlugin` back to `true` and remove the app.import() lines you added to the Brocfile.js in step 4
9. Run bash script [`./copy-fusor-ember-cli-to-ui-assets`](https://github.com/fusor/fusor-ember-cli/blob/master/copy-fusor-ember-cli-to-ui-assets) which copies files from `fusor/fusor-ember-cli/dist` to the `fusor/ui` repo
10. Git commit code
11. Send pull request. CAREFUL: Ensure that you're pull request does not include `deployAsPlugin: false` or the extra app.import() lines.
